# Assignment 3 — Docker Networking

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will explore Docker networking by using default bridge, custom bridge, multiple bridge, and host network modes. You will verify container communication, service discovery, network isolation, public access, and host networking on a Linux VM or EC2 instance.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Available Docker Networks

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker network ls
```

The output must include the default `bridge`, `host`, and `none` networks.

#### Screenshot 15 — Frontend-to-Database Isolation

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing that the `frontend` container cannot reach `db` on port `27017`.

The output must include:

```text
Expected result: frontend cannot reach db
```

![Assignment 5 Screenshots](screenshots/assgn3-img15.png)

---

#### Screenshot 16 — Public Frontend Access

Add a browser screenshot showing the Nginx Welcome Page from the `frontend` container at:

```text
http://<YOUR-VM-PUBLIC-IP>
```

# Networking Notes

Write a short note explaining:

- Default bridge networking
- Container-name communication on a custom bridge network
- Why the frontend could not access the database in Task 3
- The difference between bridge mode and host network mode

Default bridge networking: When a container starts without a specified network, Docker attaches it to the default bridge network. Containers on it get private IP addresses and can reach each other by IP, but Docker provides no automatic DNS resolution between them, so container names don't resolve. Outside access requires publishing ports with -p.

Container-name communication on a custom bridge network: A user-defined bridge network includes Docker's built-in DNS. Containers attached to it can reach each other by container name (or service name), for example mongodb://db:27017, so no hardcoded IPs are needed, even if a container restarts and its IP changes. Custom networks also provide better isolation, since only containers attached to the same network can talk to each other.

Why the frontend could not access the database in Task 3: I don't have the details of your Task 3 setup, so this is the most likely explanation based on the usual cause: the frontend and database were on different networks (or the frontend was on the default bridge while the database was on a custom network), so they were isolated from each other. Even with a shared default bridge, referring to the database by container name would fail because the default bridge has no name resolution. Placing both containers on the same custom bridge network fixes it. If your actual cause was something different (such as a wrong hostname or a deliberately isolated network), swap that in.

Bridge mode vs. host network mode: In bridge mode, the container has its own network namespace, its own IP, and is isolated from the host, with ports exposed through explicit mappings (-p 8080:80). In host mode, the container shares the host's network stack directly, so there is no isolation and no port mapping; the container's ports are bound straight to the host's interfaces. Host mode offers slightly better network performance and simpler access, but it sacrifices isolation and risks port conflicts with other services on the host.
